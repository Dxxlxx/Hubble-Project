This project estimates the Hubble Constant (H) by analyzing the relationship between the distances and velocities of galaxies based on their apparent magnitudes, absolute magnitudes, and redshifts.
Apparent Magnitude (m): Indicates the brightness of a galaxy as observed from Earth.
Absolute Magnitude (M): Indicates the intrinsic brightness of the galaxy, unaffected by distance.
Redshift (z): Measures how much light from the galaxy has been stretched due to the expansion of the universe, used to estimate velocity.
